## Overview

This lab demonstrates how to build an Azure Function App with a queue-based trigger that writes messages to a blob container.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Visual Studio Code**  
2. **.NET SDK**  
    - Check installation: `dotnet --version`
    - [Download .NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-9.0.301-windows-x64-installer)

---

## Step 1: Install Function App Extension

Install the Azure Functions extension from the VSCode Marketplace.

---

## Step 2: Install Azure Functions Core Tools

- [Download Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Cisolated-process%2Cnode-v4%2Cpython-v2%2Chttp-trigger%2Ccontainer-apps&pivots=programming-language-csharp)
- Verify installation: `func --version`

---

## Step 3: Create a Storage Account in Azure

Set up a storage account for your function app.

---

## Step 4: Create a Blob Container

- Name: `function-output-container`
- Access Level: **Container (Anonymous Access)** (not `private`)

![Container Setup](./Assets/container-setup.png)

---

## Step 5: Create an Input Queue

- Name: `function-input-queue`
- Use the same storage account as above.

---

## Step 6: Initialize the Function App

1. Open the `functionApp` folder in the integrated terminal.
2. Run `dotnet restore` to install dependencies.

![Integrated Terminal](./Assets/integrated-terminal-window.png)
![Dotnet Restore](./Assets/dotnet-restore.png)

---

## Step 7: Configure Environment Variables

Edit `local.settings.json` in the function app folder:

- **TARGET_STORAGE_ACCOUNT**: Storage account connection string
- **OUTPUT_CONTAINER_NAME**: `function-output-container`

To get the connection string, go to the **Access Keys** tab in your Azure Storage Account.

![Connection String](./Assets/connection-string.png)

Example `local.settings.json`:

Set the input queue name in `QueueTriggeredFunctionKuljot.cs` as shown:

---

## Step 8: Run the Function App Locally

1. Open the `functionApp` folder in the terminal.
2. Start the app:  
    ```
    func start host
    ```

![Function Running](./Assets/function-successfully-running.png)

---

## Step 9: Test the Function App

1. Go to the input queue and add the following JSON message:

     ```json
     {
        "name": "kuljot (MSingh) Bakshi",
        "description": "Kuljot Singh Bakshi is a dedicated Azure and AI Instructor with a wealth of experience, particularly known for his engaging courses on Udemy.

     }
     ```

     ![Add Queue Message](./Assets/add-queue-message.png)

2. Observe the function app logs in the terminal:

     ![Logs](./Assets/logs.png)

     > **Note:** After refreshing the queue, the message should disappear.

3. Check the blob container for a new `.txt` file containing the message:

## Function App Use-Case in Custom Copilot Architecture

![copilot-architecture-function-app](./Assets/copilot-architecture-function-app.png)

- **Event-Driven Processing:**  
  The Azure Function App is triggered automatically when new messages arrive in Azure Queue Storage, enabling real-time, event-driven workflows.

- **Integration with Copilot Stack:**  
  The Function App acts as a bridge between plugins, Microsoft Graph, and downstream services, processing messages generated by Copilot and its integrations.

- **Data Handling:**  
  Messages from plugins or other sources are placed in the queue and picked up by the Function App for further processing, such as writing to Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL storage.

- **Scalability:**  
  The serverless nature of Azure Functions allows the architecture to scale automatically based on the volume of incoming messages.

- **Security and Compliance:**  
  The Function App operates within a secure Azure Virtual Network and adheres to Responsible AI (RAI) principles, ensuring data privacy and compliance.

- **Seamless Integration:**  
  Works in conjunction with other Azure services like Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, and Microsoft Purview for end-to-end data flow and governance.

- **Automated Workflows:**  
  Enables automation of tasks such as data transformation, storage, and response generation within the Copilot ecosystem.

- **Monitoring and Logging:**  
  Provides detailed logs and monitoring capabilities for tracking message processing and troubleshooting issues.
